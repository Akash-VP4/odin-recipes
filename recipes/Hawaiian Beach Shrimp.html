  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This easy shrimp recipe is great for a hibachi on the beach in Hawaii or your own backyard. You can broil it in the
    oven
    if you’re not anywhere near a beach. Serve this ono (delicious) shrimp dish as a pupu (entrée) or appetizer. I
    prepare
    it either with or without the shells, depending on how fast I want people to eat ‘em up. Aloha from Hawaii!</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mayonnaise:</strong> 1 cup</li>
    <li><strong>White sugar</strong> 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li><strong>Lemon-pepper seasoning:</strong> 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li><strong>Finely minced garlic:</strong> 2 tablespoons</li>
    <li><strong>Minced fresh parsley:</strong> 1 tablespoon</li>
    <li><strong>Oyster sauce:</strong>1 tablespoon</li>
    <li><strong>Shrimp:</strong> 2 pounds extra-large shrimp (16-20), peeled and deveined, tail left on
    </li>
    <li><strong>Wooden skewers:</strong> 12 (10 inch)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix mayonnaise, sugar, lemon-pepper seasoning, garlic, parsley, and oyster sauce together in a large bowl or
      resealable
      bag until well combined. Add shrimp, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the
      refrigerator, 1 hour to overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Soak skewers in water.</li>
    <li>Remove shrimp from marinade and shake off excess. Discard remaining marinade. Thread shrimp onto skewers.
    </li>
    <li>Cook shrimp on the preheated grill until pink and firm, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
    </li>

  </ol>
